# Spicy and Taste - Online Food Ordering System

**Duration**: May 2023 - August 2023  
**Associated with**: Uva Wellassa University of Sri Lanka  

As part of our Second Year Rapid Application Development Group Project, we developed the **Spicy and Taste Online Food Ordering System** for a restaurant located in Badulla. This web application aims to streamline food distribution in areas with minimal transport facilities. It allows customers to:  
- Browse menus  
- Add items to a cart  
- Place orders  
- View their bill total  
- Receive their orders  

The project was successfully completed within three months, aligning with the restaurant's goal to launch the service by September.
